    content: "Feeding therapy is extremely helpful & strongly recommended if your child is having difficulty eating. This is most common with children that have special needs or medical challenges that may make it physically difficult for them. It is important to note that “feeding” is a specialty within a specialty. Therapy often happens on a weekly basis, but can be every other week or once a month during a scheduled block of time. But, depending on the child’s underlying challenges, you may see your child participating in a sensory integration activitiy or completing exercises to strengthen the muscles they need for eating. Our team is certified in multiple levels of oral motor therapy techniques."

  content: Magpie Speech Therapy has always believed in following E.B.P. (Evidence Based Practice) not as a matter of choice but a principle in its work style. Using non-realistic/ non-meaningful table top activities is not acceptable. A successful intervention plan begins with a detailed and thorough assessment to baseline the existing skills. The What, Why & How should be clear. Tell Me, Show Me, Involve Me and I Will Still Test It..... and Only Then Believe It.

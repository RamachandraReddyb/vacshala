  - title: How soon can we see progress in the child ?
    answer: You will see positive changes start around 8-10 session completion. We need 3 months to show significant & observable progress (Around 30 sessions). At the end of 6 months (Around 60 sessions), we usually decide whether to discharge / continue based on family needs and future course.

  - title: What is a product key?
    answer: The first meeting starts with a face to face interaction with our Center head or a Senior Speech Language Pathologist. This is important to us, as we want to know you better and hear out your concerns. Subsequently, an assessment test is carried out and a follow-up discussion is initiated based on the outcomes of the evaluation. Based on these outcomes, the candidacy for the Magpie Programs are defined and a therapist is allocated.

  - title: How long will it take to get an evaluation or therapy session at Magpie?
    answer: Parent schedules are often the determining factor in obtaining an evaluation or therapy appointment. Like other therapy centers in our area, we have a high volume of children awaiting services and the most desirable times of day are in the late afternoons and early evenings. If you are able to bring your child in between the hours of 10:00 am and 3:00 pm, it is more likely that we will be able to see your child sooner.

  - title: Why is there a waiting list for getting an evaluation or a therapy session in Magpie?
    answer: Firstly, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience on the delays. In-spite of doubling our capacity in recent times, we are experiencing high volumes and not able to meet current demand. Hence, in the interest of time, we request you to look at other therapy centers closer to your home. If you still wish to wait it out or are very particular about joining magpie, we request you to register your name and contact details and we shall get back to you on the vacancy of slots. We appreciate your patience!

  - title: How Long are the Individual Sessions at Magpie?
    answer: The Individual sessions at Magpie are for 45 Mins. Apart from that, 5 mins is allocated per session for the parent to discuss anything with the therapists. We typically need about 10 mins clean up time before beginning of the next session. However, you are welcome to schedule a meet up with the therapist based on his/her availability.

  - title: If there are many children on your waiting list, why can’t you simply hire more therapists?
    answer: We would love to be able to hire enough therapists to see every child waiting for therapy. Unfortunately, due to the increasing costs of providing therapy services and making it affordable for parents, it’s not possible for us to hire enough therapists to meet the current need for therapy. However we remain committed to serving as many families as possible in spite of these challenging financial realities.

  - title: Can I change my allocated therapist @ Magpie?
    answer: Unfortunately, you cannot. Magpie ensures each of their therapists are well trained and deliver consistently. Once a therapist is assigned, you will have to work with the therapist to meet the goals of your child. If you have concerns regarding the therapy sessions, you are welcome to discuss your concerns with the therapist and subsequently (if needed) discuss it with our center head.

  - title: Is there any limit to the number of sessions my child may have ?
    answer: Yes. Magpie Speech Therapy follows a service delivery model in which we schedule children for a series of consecutive visits followed by a break from regularly scheduled therapy. Our goal for each series of visits is to provide children and parents the tools they need to continue to meet their therapy goals even when not in therapy. This service delivery model,  at Magpie, has proven to be effective. Additionally, implementing this program allows us to better meet the high need for pediatric therapy services in our community. Children who are available between 10:00am to 3:00pm are able to receive more weekly visits than children who come in after 4:00pm.

  - title: Can I as a parent observe the therapy session?
    answer: Yes, you are most welcome to do so and we highly recommend it. We appreciate you observing the sessions, taking notes & being involved etc.. However, please note you should refrain from using mobile phones inside the therapy session and ensure your phones are in silent mode.

  - title: What can I do to make sure my child gets the therapy he/she needs within a designated time period?
    answer: We understand that parents feel frustrated and concerned when they can’t get their child in for therapy right away. There are several things that you can do to help ensure your child is seen as promptly as possible. Please make sure we have your current contact information and respond to us soon as possible when we contact you with an opening. Respond to your SMS and confirm the offered slots at the earliest! Also, let us know if your availability changes and you’re able to accept appointments earlier in the day.

  - title: I need more sessions than the prescribed 3S-2S-1S program that you have. Is it possible?
    answer: More is not always better. Magpie Speech Therapy believes in quality than quantity. While we are confident that our therapy programs can bring about changes in your child, We also understand your concern especially if you are a remote client (not based out of Bangalore) and want your child to be seen as many times in a short period. We do entertain exceptions, only on a case by case basis and this is at the discretion of our center head.

  - title: Will my child show improvement with Speech Therapy & what may be a typical time frame?
    answer: While we understand parent’s anxiety, it is difficult to answer this question. Every child is unique and our therapy techniques are customized to every child’s needs. Some children show remarkable improvement in short time, while some don’t. Our constant endeavor is to work with the child with different inputs to try our best. We cannot guarantee results.

  - title: How do Magpie ensure the quality of therapy based on varying work experience of their therapists?
    answer: Typically, when we assign a therapist to a child, we match the specialization skills of the therapist to the child’s needs. This is our standard operating procedure to get maximum alignment. Unlike other therapy centers, Magpie hires top talent and Graduates/PG candidates in Speech Language Pathology Science. Once a therapist joins Magpie (be it experienced/fresher), he/she has to undergo a vigorous training module to meet our high standards and maintain our protocols/business practices. Our therapists are also encouraged to attend different training programs and keep their skills up to date. You can expect consistency & quality attributes maintained by all our SLPs.

  - title: Can I get the lesson plan of my child or progress report detailing activities?
    answer: Magpie Speech Therapy will provide basic summary report of your child’s progress at free of cost. However, Detailed Progress Report for Schools and Other Professionals / Official establishments are chargeable. Few therapy techniques implemented by Magpie Speech Therapy comes under its Intellectual Property Rights. You are requested not to share our techniques and practices with other therapy centers. If there is a genuine need to share information, we encourage other therapy centers to contact us directly for guidelines.

  - title: Do you send your staff for home visits or to any other centers/schools?
    answer: No, We don't. Our therapists are full time consultants at the center and do not travel for any home visits/schools. Sometimes, our clients do request for a school visit for counseling purpose. These requests are at the discretion of the center and availability of the therapist. They are also charged separately.

  - title: Why doesn't Magpie have many branches like other centers out there?
    answer: Magpie has built its credibility on investing in training their staff to follow a very structured, inclusive approach. Our services require strong focus & planning of activities to make our therapy techniques effective. Each session is meticulously planned with a goal. We are not in a position to rotate our staff across different centers as its sub-optimal given the prevailing travel conditions in bangalore. While we aspire to tie up with like minded professionals and provide services close to your domicile, this strategy is still a work in progress as we expect professionals to understand our methodology, our practices and follow our strict guidelines. We hope this will become a reality someday!

    answer: ASHA (American Speech Hearing Association) states that Online speech therapy is effective in treating expressive language disorders, fluency, cognition, voice related problems related to many disorders like Autism, Aphasia, Downs syndrome, Hearing Loss, Stroke, dementia and traumatic brain injury. Each client needs to be evaluated individually and a best practice model needs to be established. Magpie provides Online Speech Therapy via our fleX module based on proven techniques and practices that it has established. It is an amalgamation of countless hours of in-person intervention techniques as well as well researched strategies for making online sessions effective.

  - title: How do kids feel about online sessions? Above what age can I engage children on online therapy?
    answer:
      Most kids above the age of 2 years love the interaction via screen. It is important that the clinician plans the activities in a manner that there is learning and engagement and not passive/ static screen viewing.

      Children below 2 year should not be exposed to direct screen/ gadgets and hence the parent coaching model needs to be embraced where in the therapist interacts with the parent over screen in daily routine activities with the child. The child need not look at the screen or interact with the therapist.

  - title: How can I track my child’s progress in Online Sessions?
    answer: Record Keeping of the session is of utmost importance and it should include documentation after each session which includes subjective measures indicating client progress and objective measures such as data collection.

  - title: How are online session supervised?
    answer: A seasoned mentor/ supervisor is also a vital step in promoting the clinicians success. The session can be recorded with the client permission and then evaluated by the supervisor. Also daily session sheets can help track the inventory of activities and associated goals.

  - title: As a parent, If i am not trained, How can I support the therapist during online sessions?
    answer: A good online therapist needs to have quality and quantity experience in parent coaching. This model is based on, encouraging questions from parents, answering these questions, summarizing the strengths, motivating the parent  and discussing the next steps with mutual consent. It is NOT being authoritarian/ scolding the parent / pointing out mistakes without feedback.

  - title: How do I decide on the quality of therapy and therapist in tele-therapy/ online therapy?
    answer: A pediatric SLP needs to have had experience in carrying out in person intervention for children and young adults. Also if she is planning oral-motor therapy goals then she needs to have the necessary qualifications. A good online therapy clinician needs to be flexible in their offering as they can provide 15 min for kids learning to establish this schedule to around 60 min sessions for a cooperative and motivated child. They anticipate issues and keep the client and their family actively engaged and informed. Setting goals and establishing regular communication to discuss progress and objectives is essential. A combination of secure email exchange, phone conversations and supervised sessions complement the success of online therapy.

  - title: How can behaviors be managed in an online session?
    answer: Difficult behaviors in children will exist just like an in person session. It is important that the Online SLP sets up the child for success by planning in advance. Using, visual schedules, positive language supports (E.g. Avoid using No and Don't rather lets put the toys inside instead of don't throw) and redirecting the child to a task can really help settle the child and engage. Sensory supports and movement breaks are necessary just like a in person session and can help to avoid difficult behaviors.

  - title: Does my child have to look at the screen and sit in the whole session?
    answer: No! We do not recommend that the child has to sit in front of the screen for an online session. Just like an in person session, the session goals would begin with building engagement with the child in his/ her favorite activities with the parent. This information will be collected before hand during the assessment so that the session can be planned and implemented via parent coaching. Once the child starts to sit, then direct teaching techniques can be incorporated.

  - title: Can my therapist help me to learn and generalize the skills outside the therapy session?
    answer: The principle objective of the therapist in an online session has to be to achieve the goal in the session and then suggest methods of incorporating the same in different routines / with different members of the family.

  - title: What is the cost and duration of the session?
    answer: The cost and duration of the session depends on the assessment outcomes, goals and setting expectations that bridge the communication status of the child & needs of the family. Please contact the center for more details. If you are not satisfied with the progress in the online sessions, we do have a refund policy.

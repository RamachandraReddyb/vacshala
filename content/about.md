 Magpie Speech Therapy was founded in 2005 & re-invented in 2013 by Namrata Pai (Gold Medalist, Speech-Language Pathologist). We provide a full range of services for children with speech, language and oral-motor disorders. These include online sessions, screenings, consultations, evaluations, and collaboration with psychologists, occupational therapists, schools and other related service providers. Our core work is built on evidence-based practices and we have successfully created and conducted multiple parent-training and social-skills programs.


 #### A MAGICAL PLACE!

Magpie Speech Therapy is the brainchild of Namrata Pai (Speech Language Pathologist). Our journey began in a small garage with 5 kids and one dream of becoming "THE" Pediatric Specialty Center offering World Class Services in the field of Speech Language Pathology. That dream has become a reality! Magpie has been including internationally researched approaches in its clinical armor and consciously adapting them to suit Indian culture and families. We fill the gap for a ethical, high quality and niche (Child Centric) speech pathology practice in India. With each passing year, we are not only adding new expertise but also creating our own clinical modules based on internal R & D (Magpie THINK Labs).

Along this journey, Magpie has built a strong team of trained, highly skilled, and dedicated speech language pathologists. We stand for exceptional therapy quality, complete parent Involvement and above all, offer a safe warm and enticing place for children with special needs.​​ Miss Magpie is our remarkable spirit that cares, comforts and welcomes every child into this wonderland of awesome toys, books and innovative activities. Involving Parents as Partners is our Motto!

Speech Language Therapy is a broad term and forms the basis of an Early Intervention Module. Once a child is assessed for a primary disorder ( E.g Autism/ADHD), or lack of it ( in case of Stuttering, Misarticulation etc), the next step is building a customized early intervention program. There are several programs being developed throughout the world for providing focused intervention in particular areas of speech language disorders. Magpie specializes in providing intervention modules on the basis of evidence based programs. Our team is trained in various globally researched programs and seeks to provide holistic communication development for your child. Please check out [international programs](https://www.magpieslp.com/). on which magpie's core fundamentals are built.â€‹

In case you are a parent interested in understanding the different types of communication disorders or wanting to know various categories of language delays, we have listed few below. However, Please note that such labeling should be ONLY done by a qualified SLP.

A speech disorder refers to a problem with the actual production of sounds. A language disorder refers to a problem understanding or putting words together to communicate ideas.

##### Speech Disorders Include:

- Articulation Disorders/Phonological Disorders: difficulties producing sounds in syllables or saying words incorrectly to the point that listeners can't understand what's being said.
- Apraxia of Speech: difficulty in motor planning for speech
- Fluency Disorders: problems such as [stuttering](http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/stutter.html), in which the flow of speech is interrupted by abnormal stoppages, partial-word repetitions ("b-b-boy"), or prolonging sounds and syllables (sssssnake).
- Resonance or Voice Disorders: Problems with the pitch, volume, or quality of the voice that distract listeners from what's being said.

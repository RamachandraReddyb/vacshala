Magpie THINK Labs

&

Hanen Parent Training Programs

Parents are the best teachers! We support holistic intervention for the child that integrates parent education into the therapy program. You’ll meet other parents in the same situations. You will have opportunities to share experiences with other parents, gain insight from their experiences, and make new friends who really understand what you’re feeling.

 

To know more about the Magpie THINK Labs programs, contact the center or click [**here**](https://www.magpieslp.com/). to know more. The strategies you’ve learned will become such a natural part of the way you interact with your child that you won’t even notice you’re using them.

 

Magpie also conducts researched parent training programs given by the Hanen Center (Canada). The program selection is based on the reason for your child’s communication delay. E.g. ITTT for parents of children with Cerebral Palsy or Down’s Syndrome, MTW for parents of children with Autism/ Social communication Disorder, Talkability for parents of children with good language but mainly peer interaction issues. Click [here](https://www.hanen.org/Special-Pages/MTW-Orientation-Session.aspx) if you want to know more about the level of your child's social communication skills.

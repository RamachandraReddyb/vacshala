##### Why we do Assessments: 

 Assessment is the first step for the clinician to interact with the child first-hand in the presence of his/her care-givers. We evaluate the child’s communication skills, play skills, auditory processing, oral motor skills and feeding (few of the assessment domains). It helps us evaluate the child’s communication domains objectively and understand family dynamics during communication interactions so that we not only offer therapy to the child but rather intervention (Intensive focused family participation) to the family.

##### How different is your Assessment (Ax) from a Pediatrician/ Psychologists evaluation? 

 Magpie assessment is from a therapy/ intervention goals point of view. Assessment done by a different professional / organization will not provide us with the information which we need to plan our goals, measure success and predict outcomes for the child.

---

##### Outcomes of Assessments:

1. Goal Setting
2. Establishing Baseline for the child  so that a review can be done every 3 months to decide the next set of goals 
3. Deciding on the IEP and number of sessions / Hours of therapy per week
4. Changes needed in the Parent interaction style 
5. Decide on candidacy for additional services likes OT, Group sessions etc.

<div class='flex'>
<div class='w-1/2'>MAGPIE has developed a proprietary assessment tool kit called the D.A.P. (Dynamic Assessment Profile). This framework is based on, child observation and identifies the pre-requisite skills and core skills for an effective prognosis. The assessment is child-friendly yet objective. Areas like Attention, Following instructions, Sentence formation, conversation skills and oral motor skills (to name a few), are evaluated in detail. The parent contributes in the evaluation process actively as a observer and participant. At the same time it also taps into the child's learning potential and is highly interactive and process oriented.

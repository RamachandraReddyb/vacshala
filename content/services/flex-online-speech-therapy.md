Online Intervention is a medium of therapy where the Speech Language Pathologist interacts with the family / client through a virtual platform. It is a combination of both the child learning with the therapist and the parent collaborating with therapist in order to achieve communication beyond the screen in terms of daily routines and interactions. We conduct online sessions on zoom platform, however we believe in being platform independent. If you are not comfortable with zoom, we can move seamlessly into any other platform of your choice.

##### REQUIREMENT FOR ONLINE THERAPY:

###### 1. Laptop & Internet Connection:

We appreciate if parents can ensure that they have good to great connectivity prior to resuming the online sessions. Classes should happen on a Laptop. Mobile phones are a big no.
s

###### 2. Active Screen Time:

It’s not necessary that the child should be seated during the complete session. Just like in an in-person session, it can be a mix of movement and seated activities. Most of the language and play based goals can be achieved via online therapy. In terms of oral motor therapy or eating disorders, more specific and specialized guidance is needed and it needs a very experienced SLP to evaluate and plan the exercises which we will guide you. Magpie fleX Online Therapy Sessions provide the child and family with S.M.A.R.T. goals and the progress can be monitored at regular intervals.

###### 3. Candidacy:

Candidates for online therapy can be children with severe immunity/ health issues, Families staying in remote areas with limited professional help, families outside India who need additional support and Families within Bangalore or in India for whom regular travel to the center can be tedious.

###### 4. Assessment:

A mandatory assessment decides the targets and duration of the session. We tailor make an intervention program based on the child and family’s requirements. A virtual meeting is then arranged with the family to set expectations in terms of the therapy program, frequency of intervention and family commitment.

The parent is the 'Hand' of the therapist and is a mandatory requirement during the assessment . This assessment provides us with a list of skills and domains to be targeted for the child and also provides a framework for Structured Parent Coaching. We like to call this as an equivalent to doing a <b>Virtual Home Visit.</b> Our Online assessment sessions consist of 2 Session (45M each) followed by 1H Session of Parent Counseling.

Each fleX session is customized, pre-planned and parents are briefed on the Session Plan beforehand with the materials to be kept ready and the expectations/outcomes from the session. Each session data is recorded. We usually see children for online sessions at least once/ to max twice a week. The session break up would be 5 min with the parent, 30 min of direct interaction with the child and 5 min of wrap up (We also have 1H fleX Sessions). The goals chosen are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound. (S.M.A.R.T.)</div>
